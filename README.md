# Pong Study

This project is meant as a personal study of C++. The code is based on the [pong game exercise](https://github.com/gameprogcpp/code/tree/master/Chapter01) found in the first chapter of [*Game Programming in C++*](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Madhav-Game-Programming-in-C-Creating-3-D-Games/PGM1102283.html) by Sanjay Madhav. Modifications were made for practicing abstract types and [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) unit testing.

## Compiling

To compile and test the project, CMake was used in [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
